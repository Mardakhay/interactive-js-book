## 📁 Project Structure

```
js_interactive_book.html   ← Everything in one file
README.md
```

## 🧠 How It Works

The entire book is a self-contained HTML file with:

- **CSS** — dark-themed responsive layout with sidebar navigation
- **HTML** — 27 lesson sections, each with explanations, code blocks, editors, and quizzes
- **Vanilla JS** — sandboxed code runner (redirects `console.log` to on-page output), quiz logic, progress tracking, and section navigation

Code in the editor runs inside a sandboxed `new Function()` scope so it cannot affect the page itself.
